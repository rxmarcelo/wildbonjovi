- Added countdown circle for seconds
- Added option to set the time of an event (hours and minutes)
- Added option to automatically hide events that took place

Please follow the instructions bellow to do the update.


Manual update (Recommended if you have done changes to the files that need to be updated):

- Added countdown circle for seconds: Add the following line to the div with class "ccounter" in your index.html:
	<div class="counter"><input class="knob second" data-readOnly="true" data-width="85" data-height="85" data-min="0" data-max="60" data-displayPrevious=true data-fgColor="#3f9f97" data-skin="beat" data-thickness=".15" value="75" /><span>SEC.</span></div>

Now the "ccounter" div should look like this:

<div class="ccounter">
	<div class="counter"><input class="knob days" data-readOnly="true" data-width="85" data-height="85" data-displayPrevious=true data-fgColor="#3f9f97" data-skin="beat" data-thickness=".15" data-min="0" data-max="365" value="75" /><span>DAYS</span></div>
	<div class="counter"><input class="knob hour" data-readOnly="true" data-width="85" data-height="85" data-min="0" data-max="24" data-displayPrevious=true data-fgColor="#3f9f97" data-skin="beat" data-thickness=".15" value="75" /><span>HOURS</span></div>
	<div class="counter"><input class="knob minute" data-readOnly="true" data-width="85" data-height="85" data-min="0" data-max="60" data-displayPrevious=true data-fgColor="#3f9f97" data-skin="beat" data-thickness=".15" value="75" /><span>MIN.</span></div>
	<div class="counter"><input class="knob second" data-readOnly="true" data-width="85" data-height="85" data-min="0" data-max="60" data-displayPrevious=true data-fgColor="#3f9f97" data-skin="beat" data-thickness=".15" value="75" /><span>SEC.</span></div>
</div>

Note that the data-width and data-height attributes of all nested inputs were changed to "85" so they could fit in the same row.
Don't forget to change the attribute data-fgColor to your own color.

Copy the files plugins.js and countdown/jquery.ccountdown.js in the update folder to the folder of your project.

Add the following lines to the end of your css/style.css file:

.ccounter .counter span{
	width:87px;
	bottom:21px;
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
	#counter-info{
		height:auto;
	}
}




- Added option to set the time of an event (hours and minutes): Add the keys "hour" and "minute" to your js/google_maps_marker/myconcerts.js array items. They now should look like this:
{
	year:2014,
	month:01,
	day:20,
	hour:22,
	minute:30,
	latitude:51.509597,
	longitude:0.015965,
	location:'The O2 - Peninsula Square, London, UK',
	infoWindow:'The great concert in Lorem Ipsum<br/>Ticket price: $80<br/><a href="#" target="_blank">Buy tickets here</a>'
}


Now open the scripts.js in the update folder and find the function "googleMap". Copy all its contents and replace in your "googleMap" function on your js/scripts.js.

Don't forget to change the variable "color" to your own color.




- Added option to automatically hide events that took place: 
It was created a new variable in the beginning of the function "googleMap" called hidePastEvents. Set this variable to true to automatically hide events that took place.





Automatic update (Only if you haven't made any changes to the files that need to be updated):

Simply copy the files in the update folder to the folder of your project.
